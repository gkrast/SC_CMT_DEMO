# SC_CMT_DEMO
CMT-B sensor board demo
This application code is provided here as open source to demonstrate the usage of the CMT-B sensor board by Senzotic. The code for supporting the control interface to the two on-board sensors HCP2080 and MS5670 is located in the corresponding libraries. In addition, the application contains the driver code for running the OLED display.
The demo application starts with the initializations of the hardware components and displaying the progress on the LCD. Then it loops sampling and displaying readings from the Temperature, Humidity and Pressure sensors and calculated Dewpoint.
You may freely use this application code as a starting point for other applications with the selected sensors and the NodeMCU module.
Happy coding!
